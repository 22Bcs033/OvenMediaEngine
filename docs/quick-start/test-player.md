The platform allows you to stream from various sources, including your webcam, microphone, screen, or an external live encoder that supports RTMP and SRT.

OvenSpace is available online, so you can try it out for yourself at [https://space.ovenplayer.com/](https://space.ovenplayer.com/). You'll get a hands-on experience of how OvenMediaEngine, OvenPlayer, and OvenLiveKit work together seamlessly to deliver top-quality streaming, whether you're a developer looking to build a media service or someone who wants to experience sub-second or low-latency streaming firsthand.

OvenSpace is also available on [Github](https://github.com/AirenSoft/OvenSpace) as open source. It will be a good reference when developing media services using OvenMediaEngine, OvenPlayer and OvenLiveKit.
